#  Kruskal Maze Generation

Modified randomized Kruskal's maze generation algorithm written in C.

## Key Difference

- Original algorithm
    - In each iteration, the algorithm will select two random adjacent nodes that belong to two different groups and merge them into one group.

- Modified algorithm
    - In each iteration, the algorithm can select L shaped three adjacent nodes that belong to three different group and merge them into one group.
